# Two-Step Sound Source Separation: Training on Learned Latent Targets

A general two-step training recipe for sound source separation. In the first step the ideal masks are learned under a front end transformation. The ideal masks or targets seve as an upper bound for source separation performance. Then we train the parameters of the separation module using SI-SDR loss on the trained latent targets. The corresponding paper has been submitted to ICASSP 2020.
